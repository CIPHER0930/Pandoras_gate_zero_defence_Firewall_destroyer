import subprocess

# This script will open all ports on the target server and make them unfiltered.

# First, we need to find the IP address of the target server. We can do this using the dig command:

target_ip = subprocess.check_output(["dig", "+short", "target_server", "A"], encoding="utf-8").strip()

# Check if the dig command failed
if not target_ip:
    print("Failed to determine target server IP address")
    exit(1)

# Now, we need to open all ports on the target server. We can do this using the ufw allow all command:

subprocess.run(["ufw", "allow", "all", "to", target_ip])

# Check if the ufw allow command failed
if returncode != 0:
    print("Failed to open ports on target server")
    exit(1)

# Finally, we need to make sure that the ports are unfiltered. We can do this using the ufw status command:

subprocess.run(["ufw", "status"])

# The output of the ufw status command will be something like this:

Status: active
To Action From
  
22/tcp ALLOW Anywhere
80/tcp ALLOW Anywhere
443/tcp ALLOW Anywhere

# This means that all ports are open and unfiltered.
